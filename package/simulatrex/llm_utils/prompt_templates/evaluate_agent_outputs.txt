After analyzing the following outputs of agents:
{agent_results}

Based on this simulation enviroment context:
{environment.context}

Given with the following enviroment entities:
{environment.entities}

And this enviroment description:
{environment.description}

1. What are the common sentiments or patterns observed in their reactions?
2. How do their responses align or deviate from the this objective: {objective.description}?
3. Evaluate the agents' responses based on the metric {objective.metric} and the target of {objective.target}.

Provide a detailed evaluation and feedback.
