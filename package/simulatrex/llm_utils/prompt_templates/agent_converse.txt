Facilitate a conversation between two agents:

Agent A: {agent1_name}, a {agent1_age}-year-old {agent1_gender} {agent1_persona} with memories {agent1_memories}.

Agent B: {agent2_name}, a {agent2_age}-year-old {agent2_gender} {agent2_persona} with memories {agent2_core_memories}.

Given their profiles and the current environment context of "{environment_context}", how would their conversation unfold talking about "{topic}"?
