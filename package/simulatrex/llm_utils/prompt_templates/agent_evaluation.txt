After analyzing the output of agent {agent_name}:
{agent_output}

Considering the simulation environment context:
{environment.context}

With the associated environment entities:
{environment.entities}

And given the environment description:
{environment.description}

1. What sentiments or patterns can be observed in {agent_name}'s reaction?
2. How does {agent_name}'s response align or deviate from the objective: {objective.description}?
3. Evaluate {agent_name}'s response based on the metric {objective.metric} and the target of {objective.target}.

Please provide a comprehensive evaluation and feedback for the agent's output.
